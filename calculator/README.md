## MSSM Lagrangian

The scalar potential is calculated by `calc_MSSM.wl`, `tools.wl`, and `convert_to_tex.pl`; files produced are:

- `Fterms.raw` and `Fterms.txt` contain each of the auxiliary F-fields.
- `FtermPotential.raw` and `FtermPotential.txt` contain the scalar potential given from the F-terms.
- `SUSYPotential.raw` and `SUSYPotential.txt` contain the full SUSY scalar potential (F and D-terms).
