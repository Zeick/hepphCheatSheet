[CheatSheet.pdf](https://github.com/misho104/hepphCheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf) is a cheatsheet for high-energy physics written by [Misho (Sho Iwamoto)](http://www.misho-web.com).

An older version is available as [CheatSheet_v1.pdf](https://github.com/misho104/hepphCheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet_v1.pdf).


### Warnings

##### Mistakes

This cheatsheet has been written since Misho was a master course student, therefore it **must** contain many mistakes, especially hasty ones.

If you find any mistakes, you are (unfortunately) asked to tell it Misho by [creating issues](https://github.com/misho104/QFTCheatSheet/issues) or by [pull requests](https://github.com/misho104/QFTCheatSheet/pulls).


##### Compiling

The TeX files include many Japanese charactors and sentences, and peculiar TeX macros.
These will prevent you from compiling the files by your environment.

This issue is going to be fixed, but you would have to be very patiant...
